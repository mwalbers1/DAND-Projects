# A/B Testing Project


## Problem Statement
---
The goal of this project is to analyze an A/B test run by an e-commerce website in order to help the 
company understand if they should keep the new web landing page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment for a longer period to make their decision.

## Jupyter Notebooks
---
There are two Jupyter notebooks for this project.  The first notebook called `Analyze AB Test Results` does an A/B test for an e-commerce website which is targeted to a business stakeholder. It presents data visualizations and detailed explanations for the findings and recommended decision.

The second Jupyter notebook called `Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook` is the original notebook from the Udacity A/B Testing project which is presented in a Question/Answer format. It has more statistical calculations and details while providing fewer visualizations.  It works on the same e-commerce experiment as the first notebook. Both notebooks arrive at the same recommendation.

If one is new to A/B Testing, it is recommended that you read through the `Analyze AB Test Results` notebook first.
